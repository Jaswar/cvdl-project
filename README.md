## Prerequisites

The packages that need to be installed are given in the `requirements.txt` file. Not all packages are however 
required to generate datasets. The only required packages for that are: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-image`.

## Generating datasets

The datasets can be generated by running the following:

```shell
python generate_datasets.py --experiment=<experiment> --seq_len=<seq_len>
```

Where experiment can be one of `pendulum`, `pendulum_scale`, `pendulum_intensity`. The parameter `seq_len` is the number 
of frames that should be generated for each sample. For example, Physics-as-Inverse-Graphics uses `seq_len=12` for training
and `seq_len=30` for testing.

## Running the models

The instructions for running the model can be found in the `README.md` file in the corresponding directories.

Please note that the Physics-as-Inverse-Graphics model also requires the path to where the datasets are located. This can
be specified using the flag `--data_dir=<path>`. The default path is `../../data/datasets/`.
